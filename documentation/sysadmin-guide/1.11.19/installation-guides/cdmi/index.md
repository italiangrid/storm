# CDMI StoRM installation and configuration guide

CDMI StoRM is a plugin for the [INDIGO DataCloud CDMI server][indigo-cdmi-server] in order to support StoRM
as storage back-end and allow users to negotiate the Quality of Service of stored data through CDMI.

In short, through the CDMI server users/admins can:

- read the status of a resource (access latency, number of replicas, size, etc..);
- schedule, if allowed, a change of its related Quality of Service.

Currently, in StoRM use case, changing the QoS of a resource means recalling a file from tape.
