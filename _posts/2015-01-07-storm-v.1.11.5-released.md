<span class="label label-info">Important</span>
A new YAIM variable for the backend service has been introduced:
`STORM_GRIDHTTPS_PUBLIC_HOST` (see the [StoRM Backend configuration
section][be-conf]).
If your StoRM deployment provides a WebDAV/HTTP endpoint, you must set this
variable to the FQDN of the machine where the webdav service is
running in order to publish the HTTP/WebDAV enpoints in the BDII.
