The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of
[StoRM 1.11.15][release-notes] that includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.15][backend-rn]
* StoRM Frontend v. [1.8.12][frontend-rn]
* StoRM WebDAV v. [1.1.0][webdav-rn]
* StoRM Info Provider v. [1.8.1][info-rn]
* YAIM StoRM v. [4.3.12][yaim-rn]

This release:

* avoids an indefinitely growth of the threads queue size due to the the
incoming requests to Frontend and the consequent block of the acceptor thread;
* fixes the `maxThread` Backend setting which wasn't honored as expected;
* improves Backend's startup thanks to a refactoring of the init scripts;
* allows to specify multiple WebDAV endpoints to be published through the info
provider, by using a new YAIM variable `STORM_WEBDAV_POOL_LIST`
(read more [here][upgrade-info-provider]);
* fixes minor issues on YAIM and storm-info-provider;
* implements basic support for Third-Party-Copy in the StoRM WebDAV service
which needs to be properly configured in order to make service working after the
update (read more [here][upgrade-webdav]);
* clears old code and stuff related to deprecated variables from YAIM, Backend
and Frontend.

Please, follow the [upgrade instructions][upgrade-instructions].
