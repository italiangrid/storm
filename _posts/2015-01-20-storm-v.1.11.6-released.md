The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of StoRM 1.11.6 that
includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.6]({{ site.baseurl }}/release-notes/storm-backend-server/1.11.6/)

This release fixes a regression that caused failures in the handling of SRM
release files requests, as highlighted in the [release notes][release-notes].

Packages can be obtained from our repositories and will soon be available on
the EMI-3 repository. Follow the instructions in the [download section]({{ site.baseurl }}/download.html).

Since 1.11.5, a new YAIM variable for the backend service has been introduced:
`STORM_GRIDHTTPS_PUBLIC_HOST` (see the [StoRM Backend configuration
section][be-conf]).
If your StoRM deployment provides a WebDAV/HTTP endpoint, you must set this
variable to the FQDN of the machine where the webdav service is
running in order to publish the HTTP/WebDAV enpoints in the BDII.
