The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of [StoRM 1.11.8][release-notes] that
includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.8][backend-rn]
* StoRM Frontend v. [1.8.8][frontend-rn]
* StoRM Info provider v. [1.7.8][info-provider-rn]

This release fixes a [critical issue][STOR-779] that prevented the proper
cleanup of PtP requests state after an srmRm was called on a SURL. As a
consequence, a SURL could remain stuck and it would be impossible to perform
other PtPs on that SURL without cleaning the database state by hand. **All sites
should upgrade to 1.11.8 at their earliest convenience to avoid being affected
by this issue**.

Details about other issues solved in this release can be found in the [release
notes][release-notes].

Packages can be obtained from our repositories and will soon be available on
the EMI-3 repository. Follow the instructions in the
[download section]({{ site.baseurl }}/download.html).
