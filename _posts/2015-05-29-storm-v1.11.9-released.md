The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of [StoRM 1.11.9][release-notes] that
includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.9][backend-rn]
* StoRM Frontend v. [1.8.9][frontend-rn]
* StoRM WebDAV v. [1.0.3-2][webdav-rn] (updated)

* StoRM Info Provider v. [1.7.8-2][info-provider-rn]
* StoRM Native Libs v. [1.0.4][native-libs-rn]

This release provides several fixes and improvements, as highlighted in the
[release notes][release-notes].

The storm-webdav package (v. 1.0.3-1) was packaged with the 1.0.2 service jar in the first
1.11.9 release. This error is now fixed with the 1.0.3-2 [storm-webdav package][webdav-rn].

Packages can be obtained from our repositories and will soon be available on
the EMI-3 repository. Follow the instructions in the
