The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of
[StoRM 1.11.13][release-notes] that includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.13][backend-rn]
* YAIM StoRM v. [4.3.10][yaim-rn]

This release provides fixes to some outstanding bugs:

* fixes a problem that prevented correct status update for tape recalls created through the REST endpoint and handled by GEMSS;
* fixes pool account mapping failures observed when StoRM is deployed with lcmaps-plugins-basic >= 1.6.3;
* enhances the request garbage collector so that PrepareToPut requests that are stuck in the state SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS are automatically expired after a configurable amount of time; see the [release notes][release-notes] for more details on how to change the default ptp expiration time (1 month);
* fixes a bug in the garbage collector so that now only recall requests older than a configurable amount of time are garbage collected.

From this release, StoRM officially supports **UMD-4** repository for SL6 (read installation instructions [here][umd-instructions].

Read the [release notes][release-notes] for more details.
