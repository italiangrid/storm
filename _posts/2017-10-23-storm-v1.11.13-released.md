The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of
[StoRM 1.11.13][release-notes] that includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.13][backend-rn]
* YAIM StoRM v. [4.3.10][yaim-rn]

This release provides fixes to some outstanding bugs:

* fixes gemss failure of recall task final status update;
* fixes pool account mapping failure that happens with lcmaps-plugins-basic versions greater than 1.6.3, by setting storm user as the owner of the gridmap directory;
* fixes garbage collector removal of SRM ptp requests that are stuck in SRM_IN_PROGRESS after long time: set the amount of seconds needed to consider an IN-PROGRESS ptp as expired by adding/editing `expired.request.ptp.time` variable value (default is 2592000L secs = 1 month) into storm.properties configuration file; 
* fixes garbage collector wrong removal of just completed recall-tasks: now it removes only a bunch of the ones that are `expired.request.time` seconds older (as well as the other asynch requests).

From this release, StoRM officially supports **UMD-4** repository for SL6 (read installation instructions [here][umd-instructions].

**UPDATE from StoRM v1.11.12**
