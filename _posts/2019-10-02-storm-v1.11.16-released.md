The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of
[StoRM 1.11.16][release-notes] that includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.16][backend-rn]
* StoRM WebDAV v. [1.2.0][webdav-rn]
* StoRM GridFTP v. [1.2.2][gridftp-rn]

This release:

*  introduces the support for the CKSUM command, so that an ADLER32 checksum is
returned if already known for a file, or computed on the fly and stored in an
extended attribute;
* introduces configurable support for Conscrypt in StoRM WebDAV that improves 
TLS performance for Java applications by delegating the handing of cryptographic
operations to boringssl (the Google fork of OpenSSL);
* fixes StoRM WebDAV startup failure due to an unreachable OpenID Connect provider
and some minor configuration issues;
* fixes error description when a SRM mkdir path contains non existing intermediate
directories.

Please, follow the [upgrade instructions][upgrade-instructions].

Starting from StoRM v1.11.14 **StoRM production repository has been migrated**. We also created a beta and a nightly yum repository too.
