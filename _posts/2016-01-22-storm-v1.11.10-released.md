The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of [StoRM 1.11.10][release-notes] that
includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.10][backend-rn]
* StoRM WebDAV v. [1.0.4][webdav-rn]
* StoRM GridHTTPs v. [3.0.4][gridhttps-rn]
* StoRM Info Provider v. [1.7.9][info-provider-rn]

It's **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to upgrade your installation to the version of StoRM WebDAV included in this release, that provides fixes for a security vulnerability affecting the Milton webdav library.

This release includes other minor fixes and improvements, as highlighted in the [release notes][release-notes].

**How to update**

Packages can be obtained from our repositories (see the instructions in the [download section][download-page]) and will soon be available on the EMI-3 repository.

To re-configure the services, follow the commands below.

- First of all, reconfigure storm-info-provider:

```bash
/usr/libexec/storm-info-provider configure
```

- Then, restart the involved services and the BDII:

```bash
service storm-backend-server restart
service storm-webdav restart
service bdii restart
```

Alternatively, you can simply run YAIM.

You can find more information about upgrade, clean installation and configuration of
StoRM services in the [System Administration Guide][storm-sysadmin-guide].
