The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of
[StoRM 1.11.11][release-notes] that includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.11][backend-rn]

This release:

* fixes a StoRM backend issue that prevented correct startup on Java 6 and 7

and introduces:

* a mechanism to gather metrics about synchronous operations load and
  performance (see [sys-admin guide logging section][logging-section]);
* changes to the Request Garbage Collector's default configuration, which now
  implements an adaptive mechanism to keep the request database dimension under
  control in high-load scenarios (see
  [sys-admin guide requests-garbage-collector section][gc-section]).

**Upgrade to StoRM v.1.11.11:**

First of all, update the involved packages:

```bash
yum update -y storm-backend-server
```

Check your `/etc/storm/backend-server` directory, you should find a new file:
`logging.xml.rpmnew`. Backup your current logging configuration and replace it
with the newest:

```bash
cd /etc/storm/backend-server
cp logging.xml logging.xml.backup
cp logging.xml.rpmnew logging.xml
```

Restart StoRM Backend service:

```bash
service storm-backend-server restart
```

See the [release notes][release-notes] for more details.
