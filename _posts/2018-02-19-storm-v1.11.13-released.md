The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of
[StoRM 1.11.13][release-notes] that includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.13][backend-rn]
* YAIM StoRM v. [4.3.10][yaim-rn]
* StoRM Info Provider v. [1.8.0][ip-rn]

This release provides fixes to some outstanding bugs:

* fixes a problem that prevented correct status update for tape recalls created through the REST endpoint;
* fixes pool account mapping failures observed when StoRM is deployed with lcmaps-plugins-basic >= 1.6.3;
* enhances the request garbage collector so that PrepareToPut requests that are stuck in the state SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS are automatically expired after a configurable amount of time (default: 1 month);
* fixes a bug in the garbage collector so that now only recall requests older than a configurable amount of time are garbage collected (default: 1 week);
* adds the ability to generate a storage usage JSON report, following the rules and format defined by [WLCG][wlcg] (read [here][how-to-report] how-to configure a periodically refreshed storage report accessed through WebDAV).
