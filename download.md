# StoRM releases

The current release is [StoRM v.{{site.latest_release}}][latest_release_notes].

{% include download/components-list.html %}

Information about previous releases can be found [here](releases.html) or on the [EMI website](http://www.eu-emi.eu).

### Repository configuration

StoRM packages can be obtained from the UMD repositories for SL6 or from the StoRM product team package repository.

#### UMD

> <span class="label label-info" style="margin-top: -20px;">NEW</span> StoRM v1.11.13 supports UMD-4 repositories.

You can find [general UMD 4 installation instructions][UMD4site] on the EGI site, 
but it basically boils down to installing the UMD repositories.

In short:

```shell
# Install UMD rpm pgp-key
rpm --import http://repository.egi.eu/sw/production/umd/UMD-RPM-PGP-KEY
# Download and install UMD release
wget http://repository.egi.eu/sw/production/umd/4/sl6/x86_64/updates/umd-release-4.1.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm
yum localinstall umd-release-4.1.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm
```

Follow the [system administration guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/sysadmin-guide/) for detailed installation instructions.

#### StoRM

The latest certified [StoRM packages][prod_repo_url] can be found in the StoRM
production repositories for [SL6][prod_repo_sl6].
Note that you should also have UMD repositories installed (as detailed above) for
your setup to work as expected.

To install the StoRM production repository files, run the following commands (as root):

    wget http://italiangrid.github.io/storm/repo/storm_sl6.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/storm_sl6.repo

### Preview releases

### Nightly builds

Artifacts for the development branch (not recommended for production) can be found in the development
yum repositories for [SL6][devel_repo_sl6].
