## StoRM v. 1.11.3

Released on **{{ page.release_date }}**

### Description

This release provides fixes for security vulnerabilities that were recently reported, and several bug fixes.

<span class="label label-info">Important</span> A security authentication token is now used
to secure all communication among the storm-frontend and grihttps services and the 
backend. The token is configured using the `STORM_BE_XMLRPC_TOKEN` YAIM variable for
the three services. More details in the [System administrator guide][storm-sysadmin-guide].

<span class="label label-info">Important</span> The webdav service now responds on 
the `/webdav/[storage-area]` path. More details in the [WebDAV interface guide][storm-webdav-guide]. 

<span class="label label-info">Important</span> Please ensure that storage area file permissions are 
correctly set. Follow these [instructions][file-perms-section] before running the gridhttps server.
