## StoRM Info Provider v. 1.8.1

Released on **{{ page.release_date }}** with [StoRM v. 1.11.15][release-notes].

### Description

This release fixes the JSON storage report generation as follow:

1. The root of the JSON is an object with only one key: `storageservice`. Its value is an object where everything else is put.
2. The `endpoints` key has been renamed to `storageendpoints`.
3. The `shares` key has been renamed to `storageshares`.
4. Fixed share's VO list when multiple VOs are defined as an array.
5. The name of the shares matches the corresponding space token.

Check the [How-To][how-to-json-report] documentation section to learn how to
configure StoRM to share the JSON storage report.

This release also allows to specify multiple WebDAV endpoints by using the new
YAIM variable `STORM_WEBDAV_POOL_LIST`, as a comma separated list.
The old strategy used to publish the StoRM WebDAV endpoint is still supported
but deprecated.

### Bug fixes

### Enhancements

{% include list-features.liquid %}

### Installation and configuration

Update package:

    yum update storm-dynamic-info-provider

To publish a WebDAV endpoint use `STORM_WEBDAV_POOL_LIST` variable instead of
the deprecated variables:

- STORM_GRIDHTTPS_ENABLED
- STORM_GRIDHTTPS_PUBLIC_HOST
- STORM_GRIDHTTPS_HTTP_PORT
- STORM_GRIDHTTPS_HTTPS_PORT

All the webdav endpoints must be declared as a comma-separated list:

```
STORM_WEBDAV_POOL_LIST=http://storm-webdav.example.org:8085,https://storm-webdav.example.org:8443
```

Then run YAIM.

The deprecated variables can still be used within StoRM 1.11.15 but they won't be
supported by next releases.

This migration/upgrade allows site administrators to publish a well defined list
of DAV endpoints, in order to overcome the previous limitations.

You can find information about upgrade, clean installation and configuration of
StoRM services in the [System Administration Guide][storm-sysadmin-guide].
