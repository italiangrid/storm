Released on **{{ page.release_date }}** with [StoRM v. 1.11.21][release-notes].
<span style="float: right; margin-left: 8px;" class="label label-info">centos7</span>

### Description

This release:

* fixes the [known issue][known-issue-post] about the upgrade to StoRM v1.11.20 which could break connections with MariaDB;
* fixes the boot order ensuring that mariadb service is started before StoRM Backend;
* fixes the failed state shown on stop/restart of the service due to a misunderstood exit code meaning.

We should be able to suppress this by adding the exit code into the unit file as a "success" exit status:

### Bug fixes

### Installation and configuration

If you're upgrading, you can update and restart StoRM backend service as follow:
