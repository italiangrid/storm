## StoRM v. 1.11.16

Released on **{{ page.release_date }}**.

Supported platforms: <span class="label label-success">CentOS 6</span>

#### Description

This release:

*  introduces the support for the CKSUM command, so that an ADLER32 checksum is
returned if already known for a file, or computed on the fly and stored in an
extended attribute;
* introduces configurable support for Conscrypt in StoRM WebDAV that improves 
TLS performance for Java applications by delegating the handing of cryptographic
operations to boringssl (the Google fork of OpenSSL);
* fixes StoRM WebDAV startup failure due to an unreachable OpenID Connect provider
and some minor configuration issues;
* fixes error description when a SRM mkdir path contains non existing intermediate
directories.
