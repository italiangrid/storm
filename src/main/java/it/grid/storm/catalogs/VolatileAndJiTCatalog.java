/**
 * This catalog holds all info needed to pin files for JiT ACL tracking, and
 * for keeping track of Volatile files. pinLifetime is the time Jit ACLs will be
 * in place: upon expiry ACLs are removed; fileLifetime is the time Volatile
 * files will remain in the system: upon expiry those files are removed. In
 * particular the srmPrepareToPut analyzes the request and if the specified file
 * is set to Volatile, then it calls on the catalog to add the corresponding
 * entry for the given fileLifetime. If StoRM is configured for JiT, another
 * method is invoked to add an entry to keep track of the ACLs for the desired
 * pinLifetime. For srmPrepareToGet, only if StoRM is configured for JiT ACLs
 * then a method is invoked to add the corresponding entry for the given
 * pinLifetime. Repeatedly putting the same Volatile file, will overwrite
 * existing fileLifetime only if the overwrite option allows file overwriting.
 * If JiT is enabled and it is a new user that is putting again the same file
 * in, a new pinLifetime entry is added; but if it is the same user, the
 * pinLifetime WILL be changed provided the new expiry exceeds the current one!
 * Repeatedly invoking PtG on the same file behaves similarly: different users
 * will have their own pinLifetime record, but the same user WILL change the
 * pinLifetime provided the new expiry exceeds the current one! In case the
 * pinLifetime exceeds the fileLifetime, the fileLifetime is used as ceiling.
 * This may occur when a file is Put and defined Volatile, but with a
 * pinLifetime that is longer than that of the pin. Or if _subsequent_ calls to
 * PtG specify a pinLifetime that lasts longer. To be more precise, the
 * pinLifetime gets recorded as requested, but upon expiry of the volatile entry
 * any associated acl will get removed as well, regardless of the acl expiry.
 * When lifetime expires: volatile files get erased from the system and their
 * entries in the catalog are removed; tracked ACLs get removed from the files
 * WITHOUT erasing the files, and their entries in the catalog are removed;
 * finally for Volatile files with ACLs set up on them, the ACLs are removed AND
 * the files are erased, also cleaning up the catalog. As a last note, the
 * catalog checks periodically its entries for any expired ones, and then
 * proceeds with purging; this frequency of cleaning is specified in a
 * configuration parameter, and the net effect is that the pinning/volatile may
 * actually last longer (but never less) because the self cleaning mechanism is
 * active only at those predetermined times.
